Sage WebUI transforms how you interact with AI. Built for privacy and flexibility, it runs entirely on your infrastructure while supporting the latest AI models from Ollama, OpenAI, and beyond.

## Why Sage WebUI?

**Privacy First** — Your conversations never leave your server. Complete data sovereignty.

**Universal Compatibility** — Works with Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, and any OpenAI-compatible API.

**Built for Teams** — Granular permissions, user groups, and role-based access control.

**Extensible** — Plugin architecture, custom functions, and RAG integration out of the box.

## Quick Start

### Using Make (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sage-is/AI-UI.git
cd AI-UI
make it_build_n_run
```


Now open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and create your admin account.

If you want to do front end dev and see changes to svelte files live, go instead to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) as this will update on file change.

## Configuration

Sage WebUI works out of the box, but you can customize it:

**Environment Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — Connect to OpenAI models
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Enable Claude models  
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` — Point to your Ollama instance
- `ENABLE_RAG` — Enable document processing (default: true)


## Styling

Sage WebUI uses [Startr.Style](https://startr.style) — a utility-complete CSS framework under 50KB (8KB gzipped). Instead of class-based utilities, Startr.Style uses inline CSS custom properties for full access to the CSS spec with zero compilation:

```html
<div style="--d:flex; --ai:center; --g:1rem; --p:1rem; --br:0.5rem">
  <button style="--bg:var(--color-sky-500); --c:white; --hvr-bg:var(--color-sky-600)">
    Click me
  </button>
</div>
```

See [Startr.Style docs](https://startr.style) for the full property reference, responsive suffixes (`-sm`, `-md`, `-lg`, `-xl`), dark mode (`--dark-*`), and hover states (`--hvr-*`).

## License

[GNU Affero General Public License v3](LICENSE)

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3 is used here because this project (Sage WebUI) is a web-based AI interface that runs as a network service, and AGPL ensures that any modifications or derivative works—especially those deployed online—must also be open-sourced under the same license. This prevents proprietary exploitation of the codebase while allowing free use and modification.

It protects developers by:

- Enforcing copyleft: Any changes or extensions to the software must be shared back with the community, preserving the open-source nature and preventing companies from taking the code private without contributing improvements.
- Safeguarding against SaaS loopholes: Unlike GPL, AGPL closes the "SaaS loophole" by requiring source code availability for network-accessible versions, ensuring users can access and modify the software even when it's hosted as a service.
- Promoting collaboration: It encourages contributions by guaranteeing that enhancements benefit everyone, reducing the risk of forks diverging into incompatible proprietary versions.
- Legal clarity: It provides strong protections against patent claims and ensures freedom to run, study, share, and modify the code, with no warranties but clear liability limits.

This aligns with the project's privacy-first ethos, as it keeps AI interfaces open and accountable.
